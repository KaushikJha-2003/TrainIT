# 📚 COVID-19 Case Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Project Description
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for accurate case predictions to assist healthcare systems and government agencies in resource allocation and decision-making. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases based on data from multiple sources, including:

- Daily COVID-19 confirmed cases by state.
- COVID-19 testing data, including the number of tests conducted.
- Vaccination data tracking the administration of vaccines over time.
